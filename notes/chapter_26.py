CHAPTER 26 - ORES, SLAG AND ASH

Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Slag or similar industrial waste prepared as macadam (heading 2517);
   (b) Natural magnesium carbonate (magnesite), whether or not calcined (heading 2519);
   (c) Sludges from petroleum oil storage tanks, consisting mainly of such oils (heading 2710);
   (d) Basic slag of chapter 31;
   (e) Slag wool, rock wool or similar mineral wools (heading 6806);
   (f) Waste/scrap of precious metal or metal clad with precious metal; other waste/scrap containing precious metal/compounds for precious metal recovery (heading 7112 or 8549);
   (g) Copper, nickel or cobalt mattes produced by smelting (section XV).

2. "Ores" (headings 2601-2617) = minerals of mineralogical species actually used in metallurgical industry for extracting mercury, metals of heading 2844, or metals of section XIV/XV, even if intended for non-metallurgical purposes. EXCLUDES: minerals submitted to non-normal metallurgical processes.

3. Heading 2620 applies ONLY to:
   (a) Slag, ash, residues used industrially for metal extraction or chemical compound manufacture. EXCLUDES: ash/residues from municipal waste incineration (heading 2621);
   (b) Slag, ash, residues containing arsenic (whether or not with metals) for arsenic/metal extraction or chemical compound manufacture.

Subheading Notes:
1. "Leaded gasoline sludges and leaded anti-knock compound sludges" (subheading 2620.21.00) = sludges from storage tanks of leaded gasoline/anti-knock compounds (e.g., tetraethyl lead), consisting essentially of lead, lead compounds, iron oxide.

2. Slag, ash, residues containing arsenic, mercury, thallium or mixtures thereof (for extraction of these metals or chemical compound manufacture) → subheading 2620.60.

Statistical Notes:
1. Metal content quantity reported = assay quantity without deductions.
2. "Coarse" iron ores (subheading 2601.11.0060) = majority of particles >4.75mm diameter.
3. For subheadings requiring named metal content reporting: report weight and value of each metal contained. If multiple named metals present, enter multiple ten-digit subheadings with each metal's weight/value.
