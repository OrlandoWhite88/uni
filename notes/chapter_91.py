CHAPTER 91 - CLOCKS AND WATCHES AND PARTS THEREOF

Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Clock or watch glasses or weights (classified by constituent material);
   (b) Watch chains (heading 7113 or 7117);
   (c) Parts of general use (section XV note 2) of base metal, or similar goods of plastics (chapter 39) or precious metal or metal clad with precious metal (generally heading 7115); HOWEVER: clock or watch springs → heading 9114;
   (d) Bearing balls (heading 7326 or 8482);
   (e) Articles of heading 8412 constructed to work without escapement;
   (f) Ball bearings (heading 8482);
   (g) Articles of chapter 85 not yet assembled together or with other components into watch or clock movements or articles suitable solely or principally as parts of such movements (chapter 85).

2. Heading 9101 covers ONLY watches with case wholly of precious metal or metal clad with precious metal, or same materials combined with natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semiprecious stones (natural, synthetic, or reconstructed) of headings 7101-7104. Watches with base metal case inlaid with precious metal → heading 9102.

3. "Watch movements" = devices regulated by balance wheel and hairspring, quartz crystal, or any other system capable of determining time intervals, with display or system for incorporating mechanical display. Shall NOT exceed 12 mm thick and 50 mm in width, length, or diameter.

4. Except as provided in note 1, movements and other parts suitable for use both in clocks or watches and in other articles (e.g., precision instruments) → classify in this chapter.

Additional U.S. Notes:
(a) "Watches" = timepieces (including chronographs, calendar watches, skin diving watches) for wearing or carrying on person, whether or not movement conforms to "watch movements" definition. Timepieces with stand (however simple) are NOT classifiable as watches.

(b) "Cases" = inner and outer cases, containers and housings for movements, plus parts or pieces (rings, feet, posts, bases, outer frames), and any auxiliary or incidental features, which (with appropriate movements) complete watches, clocks, time switches, and other apparatus of this chapter.

(c) "Jewels" includes substitutes for jewels.

(d) "Clock movements" = devices regulated by balance wheel and hairspring, quartz crystal, or any other system capable of determining time intervals, with display or system for incorporating mechanical display. Clock movements shall EITHER exceed 12 mm thick OR 50 mm in width, length, or diameter, OR BOTH.

(e) "Complete watch or clock movements, unassembled or partly assembled (movement sets)" = sets with all parts necessary to assemble watch or clock movement, EXCEPT for movements with mechanical displays, set may or may not include dial and hands.

(f) "Incomplete watch or clock movements, assembled" = 
    (i) Mechanical movements mounted but lacking certain parts other than dial, hands, or winding spindle (e.g., escapement or barrel bridge);
    (ii) Battery powered movements with mechanical displays mounted but lacking certain parts other than dial, hands, setting spindle, or battery (e.g., motor);
    (iii) Other movements for opto-electronic displays mounted but lacking certain parts other than battery (e.g., display).

(g) "Rough watch or clock movements" = sets of unassembled parts for watch or clock movements constructed to work with escapement. Do NOT include escapement, balance wheel and hairspring or other regulating device, mainspring, dial, or hands. Mainly consist of base plate (and additional plates), bridges, train, motion work, winding and setting mechanism, and additional mechanisms (automatic winding, calendar, chronograph, alarm, etc.). May be entered with or without barrel.

Watch straps, bands, and bracelets entered with wrist watches (of a kind normally sold therewith), whether or not attached → classify with watch in heading 9101 or 9102. Otherwise → heading 9113.

Batteries entered with battery powered watches or clocks, or with their complete assembled movements, and intended for use therewith → classify with watch, clock, or movement. Batteries entered with movement sets or incomplete assembled movements and intended for use therewith → classify with such movement. Otherwise → heading 8506 or 8507.

SPECIAL MARKING REQUIREMENTS: any movement or case provided for in this chapter (whether imported separately or attached to an article of this chapter) shall not be entered unless conspicuously and indelibly marked by cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping (including indelible ink), or mold-marking (indented or raised). Movements with opto-electronic display only and cases designed for use therewith are EXCEPTED.

Marking requirements:
(a) Watch movements (on one or more bridges or top plates): (i) country of manufacture; (ii) manufacturer or purchaser name; (iii) in words, number of jewels (if any) serving mechanical purpose as frictional bearings.
(b) Clock movements (on most visible part of front or back plate): (i) country of manufacture; (ii) manufacturer or purchaser name; (iii) number of jewels (if any).
(c) Watch cases (on inside or outside of back): (i) country of manufacture; (ii) manufacturer or purchaser name.
(d) Clock cases (on most visible part of outside of back): country of manufacture.
