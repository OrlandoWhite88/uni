       (5) Products in note 3(a) or 3(c);
   (b) Chemical/foodstuff mixtures with nutritive value for human food preparation (generally heading 2106);
   (c) Products of heading 2404;
   (d) Slag, ash, residues (including sludges, other than sewage sludge) with metals, arsenic or mixtures meeting chapter 26 note 3(a)/(b) (heading 2620);
   (e) Medicaments (heading 3003 or 3004);
   (f) Spent catalysts for base metal extraction or base metal chemical compound manufacture (heading 2620); spent catalysts principally for precious metal recovery (heading 7112); metal/alloy catalysts as finely divided powder or woven gauze (section XIV or XV).

2. (a) "Certified reference materials" (heading 3822) = reference materials with certificate indicating: certified property values, determination methods, certainty degree for each value; suitable for analytical, calibrating, or referencing purposes.
   (b) Except for chapter 28/29 products, heading 3822 takes precedence over any other tariff heading for certified reference materials.

3. Heading 3824 includes (not classified elsewhere):
   (a) Cultured crystals ≥2.5g each of magnesium oxide or alkali/alkaline-earth metal halides (other than optical elements);
   (b) Fusel oil; Dippel's oil;
   (c) Retail ink removers;
   (d) Stencil correctors, other correcting fluids, correction tapes (other than heading 9612), retail packings;
   (e) Ceramic firing testers, fusible (e.g., Seger cones).

4. "Municipal waste" = waste from households, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, shops, offices; road/pavement sweepings; construction/demolition waste. Contains plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass, metals, food materials, broken furniture, discarded articles.
   EXCLUDES:
   (a) Segregated individual materials/articles (plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass, metals, electrical/electronic waste, spent batteries) → appropriate headings;
   (b) Industrial waste;
   (c) Waste pharmaceuticals (chapter 30 note 4(k));
   (d) Clinical waste (note 6(a)).

5. "Sewage sludge" (heading 3825) = sludge from urban effluent treatment plants (includes pre-treatment waste, scourings, unstabilized sludge). EXCLUDES: stabilized sludge suitable as fertilizer (chapter 31).

6. "Other wastes" (heading 3825):
   (a) Clinical waste = contaminated waste from medical research, diagnosis, treatment, or other medical/surgical/dental/veterinary procedures (often contains pathogens, pharmaceuticals, requires special disposal) e.g., soiled dressings, used gloves, used syringes;
   (b) Waste organic solvents;
   (c) Wastes of metal pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids, anti-freezing fluids;
   (d) Other wastes from chemical or allied industries.
   EXCLUDES: wastes containing mainly petroleum oils or oils from bituminous minerals (heading 2710).

7. "Biodiesel" (heading 3826) = mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids used as fuel, derived from animal, vegetable or microbial fats/oils (whether or not used).

Subheading Notes:
1. Subheadings 3808.52 and 3808.59: goods containing one or more of: alachlor, aldicarb, aldrin, azinphos-methyl, binapacryl, camphechlor (toxaphene), captafol, carbofuran, chlordane, chlordimeform, chlorobenzilate, DDT, dieldrin, DNOC or salts, dinoseb/salts/esters, endosulfan, ethylene dibromide, ethylene dichloride, fluoroacetamide, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, HCH (including lindane), mercury compounds, methamidophos, monocrotophos, oxirane (ethylene oxide), parathion, parathion-methyl, pentachlorophenol/salts/esters, perfluorooctane sulphonic acid/salts, perfluorooctane sulphonamides, perfluorooctane sulphonyl fluoride, phosphamidon, 2,4,5-T/salts/esters, tributyltin compounds, trichlorfon.
   Subheading 3808.59 also: dustable powder formulations with benomyl + carbofuran + thiram mixture.

2. Subheadings 3808.61-3808.69: goods containing alpha-cypermethrin, bendiocarb, bifenthrin, chlorfenapyr, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, etofenprox, fenitrothion, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, or propoxur.
