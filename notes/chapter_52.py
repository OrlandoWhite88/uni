CHAPTER 52 - COTTON

Subheading Note:
"Denim" (subheadings 5209.42, 5211.42) = fabrics of yarns of different colors, 3-thread or 4-thread twill (including broken twill), warp faced, where warp yarns are one same color and weft yarns are unbleached, bleached, dyed grey, or colored lighter shade of warp yarn color.

Statistical Note - Woven fabric definitions:
(a) "Poplin or broadcloth" = plain weave, not square construction, whether or not napped. EXCLUDES: fabrics ≤200 g/m² with ≤33 warp ends and filling picks per cm²; fabrics >200 g/m² of average yarn number 26 or lower.

(b) "Sheeting" = plain weave, whether or not napped:
    (i) ≤200 g/m², square construction, >33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², average yarn number 68 or lower (excluding printcloth);
    (ii) >200 g/m², EXCLUDING: fabrics with multiple/cabled warp or filling yarns of average yarn number 26 or lower; fabrics of average yarn number 27+ not of square construction.

(c) "Cheesecloth" = plain weave, ≤200 g/m², ≤33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², whether or not napped.

(d) "Printcloth" = plain weave, ≤200 g/m², average yarn numbers 43-68, >33 singles yarns per cm², no multiple/cabled yarns, square construction, not combed, whether or not napped.

(e) "Lawns, voiles or batistes" = plain weave, ≤200 g/m², average yarn number 69+, >33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², square construction, whether or not napped.

(f) "Sateens" = satin weave fabrics, whether or not napped.

(g) "Oxford cloth" = ≤200 g/m², whether or not napped, woven as plain weave except two or more warp ends woven as one (taped warp). NOT classified as plain weave fabric.

(h) "Duck" = >200 g/m², average yarn number 26 or lower, whether or not napped:
    (i) Plain weave with multiple/cabled warp or filling yarns; OR
    (ii) Woven as plain weave with taped warp (whether or not with multiple/cabled yarns). NOT classified as plain weave.

(ij) "Square construction":
    (i) <79 warp ends and filling picks per cm², difference between warp ends/cm and filling picks/cm is <11; OR
    (ii) ≥79 warp ends and filling picks per cm², where each count is <57% of total count per cm².

(k) "Napped" = fuzzy, fibrous surface from scratching/pricking surface to raise fibers from yarn body. NOT pile fabrics. Examples: outing flannel, canton flannel, moleskin.

(l) "Not combed" = fabrics wholly or partly of uncombed cotton, other vegetable textile fibers, wool, or fine animal hair.

(m) "Combed" = fabrics containing combed cotton, other vegetable textile fibers, wool, or fine animal hair (whether or not containing other fibers).

(n) "Osnaburg" = plain weave, square construction, not combed, not napped, >200 g/m², average yarn number 22 or lower, <28 warp ends and filling picks per cm.

(o) "Blue denim" = 3-thread or 4-thread twill (including broken twill), warp faced, blue-dyed warp yarns, weft yarns unbleached/bleached/dyed grey/lighter blue than warp.

(p) "Discharge printed" = fabrics: (i) dyed single uniform color (not white, not tinted); (ii) processed with chlorine/color-destroying chemicals to bleach out dye in discrete portions, then printed to yield different colored pattern on dyed ground; (iii) subjected to 2+ finishing operations (bleaching, shrinking, filling, napping, decating, permanent stiffening, weighting, permanent embossing, moireing).
