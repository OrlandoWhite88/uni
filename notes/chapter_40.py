CHAPTER 40 - RUBBER AND ARTICLES THEREOF

Notes:
1. "Rubber" throughout tariff schedule (unless context requires otherwise) = natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle, similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, reclaimed substances of these - whether or not vulcanized or hard.

2. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Goods of section XI (textiles and textile articles);
   (b) Footwear or parts of chapter 64;
   (c) Headgear or parts (including bathing caps) of chapter 65;
   (d) Mechanical or electrical appliances or parts of section XVI (including all electrical goods) of hard rubber;
   (e) Articles of chapter 90, 92, 94, or 96;
   (f) Articles of chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens, mitts and articles of headings 4011-4013).

3. "Primary forms" (headings 4001-4003, 4005) applies ONLY to:
   (a) Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not prevulcanized, and other dispersions/solutions);
   (b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs, similar bulk forms.

4. "Synthetic rubber" (note 1 and heading 4002):
   (a) Unsaturated synthetic substances irreversibly transformable by sulfur vulcanization into non-thermoplastic substances which at 18-29°C:
       - Will NOT break when extended to 3× original length; AND
       - Return within 5 minutes to ≤1.5× original length after being extended to 2× original length.
       Cross-linking substances (vulcanizing activators/accelerators) may be added; substances in note 5(b)(ii)/(iii) permitted. Extenders, plasticizers, fillers NOT permitted;
   (b) Thioplasts (TM);
   (c) Natural rubber modified by grafting/mixing with plastics, depolymerized natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers - PROVIDED they comply with vulcanization, elongation, recovery requirements in (a).

5. (a) Headings 4001 and 4002 do NOT apply to rubber/mixtures compounded (before or after coagulation) with:
       (i) Vulcanizing agents, accelerators, retarders, activators (other than for prevulcanized rubber latex);
       (ii) Pigments or other coloring matter other than solely for identification;
       (iii) Plasticizers or extenders (except mineral oil for oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents, any other substances except (b);
   
   (b) These substances do NOT affect classification in heading 4001 or 4002 IF rubber retains essential character as raw material:
       (i) Emulsifiers or antitack agents;
       (ii) Small amounts of emulsifier breakdown products;
       (iii) Very small amounts of: heat-sensitive agents (for thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (for electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptizers, preservatives, stabilizers, viscosity-control agents, similar special-purpose additives.

6. "Waste, parings and scrap" (heading 4004) = rubber waste, parings, scrap from manufacture/working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such due to cutting-up, wear, or other reasons.

7. Vulcanized rubber thread with any cross-sectional dimension >5mm → classify as strip, rods, or profile shapes (heading 4008).

8. Heading 4010 includes: conveyor/transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered, or laminated with rubber; or made from textile yarn/cord impregnated, coated, covered, or sheathed with rubber.

9. "Plates", "sheets", "strip" (headings 4001, 4002, 4003, 4005, 4008) = plates, sheets, strip, and regular geometric shape blocks, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having article character, whether or not printed/surface-worked, but NOT otherwise cut to shape or further worked.

10. "Rods" and "profile shapes" (heading 4008) = such products whether or not cut to length or surface-worked, but NOT otherwise worked.
