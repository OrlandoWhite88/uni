CHAPTER 28 - INORGANIC CHEMICALS; ORGANIC OR INORGANIC COMPOUNDS OF PRECIOUS METALS, RARE-EARTH METALS, RADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS OR ISOTOPES

Notes:
1. Unless context requires otherwise, chapter headings apply only to:
   (a) Separate chemical elements and separate chemically defined compounds (whether or not with impurities);
   (b) Products of (a) dissolved in water;
   (c) Products of (a) dissolved in other solvents, IF solution is normal/necessary for safety or transport AND solvent doesn't render product suitable for specific use;
   (d) Products of (a)-(c) with added stabilizer (including anticaking agent) for preservation/transport;
   (e) Products of (a)-(d) with antidusting agent or coloring substance for identification/safety, PROVIDED additions don't render product suitable for specific use.

2. Carbon compounds classified in this chapter (besides those in headings 2831, 2836, 2837, 2842, 2843-2846, 2849, 2852):
   (a) Oxides of carbon, hydrogen cyanide, fulminic/isocyanic/thiocyanic/other cyanogen acids (heading 2811);
   (b) Halide oxides of carbon (heading 2812);
   (c) Carbon disulfide (heading 2813);
   (d) Thiocarbonates, selenocarbonates, tellurocarbonates, selenocyanates, tellurocyanates, reineckates, other complex cyanates of inorganic bases (heading 2842);
   (e) Hydrogen peroxide solidified with urea (heading 2847); carbon oxysulfide, thiocarbonyl halides, cyanogen, cyanogen halides, cyanamide and metal derivatives (heading 2853) - except calcium cyanamide (chapter 31).

3. Subject to section VI note 1, this chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Sodium chloride, magnesium oxide (whether or not pure), other section V products;
   (b) Organo-inorganic compounds other than note 2 above;
   (c) Products of chapter 31 notes 2, 3, 4, 5;
   (d) Inorganic luminophores (heading 3206); glass frit and other glass as powder/granules/flakes (heading 3207);
   (e) Artificial graphite (heading 3801); fire-extinguisher charges/grenades (heading 3813); retail ink removers (heading 3824); cultured crystals ≥2.5g each of alkali/alkaline-earth halides (heading 3824);
   (f) Precious/semiprecious stones or dust/powder (headings 7102-7105); precious metals/alloys of chapter 71;
   (g) Metals (pure or not), metal alloys, cermets (including sintered metal carbides) of section XV;
   (h) Optical elements of alkali/alkaline-earth halides (heading 9001).

4. Complex acids of nonmetal acid (subchapter II) + metal acid (subchapter IV) → heading 2811.

5. Headings 2826-2842: apply only to metal or ammonium salts or peroxysalts.

6. Double or complex salts → heading 2842, unless context requires otherwise.

7. Heading 2844 applies ONLY to:
   (a) Technetium (43), promethium (61), polonium (84), all elements with atomic number >84;
   (b) Natural or artificial radioactive isotopes (including precious/base metals), whether or not mixed;
   (c) Compounds (inorganic/organic) of these elements/isotopes, whether or not chemically defined or mixed;
   (d) Alloys, dispersions (including cermets), ceramic products, mixtures containing these elements/isotopes/compounds with specific radioactivity >74 Bq/g (0.002 microcurie/g);
   (e) Spent (irradiated) nuclear reactor fuel elements (cartridges);
   (f) Radioactive residues (whether or not usable).
   
   "Isotopes" = individual nuclides (excluding monoisotopic natural nuclides) OR mixtures of isotopes of same element enriched in one or more isotopes (artificially modified isotopic composition).

8. Heading 2853: includes copper phosphide (phosphor copper) with >15% phosphorus by weight.

9. Chemical elements (e.g., silicon, selenium) doped for electronics → this chapter IF in forms unworked as drawn, or as cylinders/rods. Cut as discs/wafers/similar → heading 3818.

Subheading Note:
"Chemically defined" (subheading 2852.10) = organic/inorganic mercury compounds meeting chapter 28 note 1(a)-(e) or chapter 29 note 1(a)-(h).

Statistical Note:
"m³" (cubic meter) for heading 2804 = standard cubic meter at 21°C at 760mm (1013 millibars) pressure.
