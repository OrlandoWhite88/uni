CHAPTER 27 - MINERAL FUELS, MINERAL OILS AND PRODUCTS OF THEIR DISTILLATION; BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES; MINERAL WAXES

Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds, EXCEPT pure methane and propane (heading 2711);
   (b) Medicaments of heading 3003 or 3004;
   (c) Mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 3301, 3302 or 3805.

2. "Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals" (heading 2710) includes:
   - Petroleum oils and oils from bituminous minerals
   - Similar oils and those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons (obtained by any process)
   - PROVIDED nonaromatic constituents weight exceeds aromatic constituents weight
   - EXCLUDES: liquid synthetic polyolefins with <60% by volume distilling at 300°C (at 1,013 millibars) → chapter 39.

3. "Waste oils" (heading 2710) = waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils from bituminous minerals (per note 2), whether or not mixed with water. Includes:
   (a) Oils no longer fit for primary use (e.g., used lubricating oils, hydraulic oils, transformer oils);
   (b) Sludge oils from petroleum storage tanks (mainly oils + high concentration of additives/chemicals from primary product manufacture);
   (c) Oils as emulsions/mixtures with water (from oil spills, storage tank washings, cutting oil machining operations).

Statistical Note:
"Renewable fuels" (statistical reporting number 2710.12.4560) = fuels from biogenic material per ISO 16620-2 method (equivalent to ASTM D 6866).
