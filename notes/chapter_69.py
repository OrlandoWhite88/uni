CHAPTER 69 - CERAMIC PRODUCTS

Notes:
1. This chapter applies ONLY to ceramic products fired after shaping:
   (a) Headings 6904-6914 apply only to products other than those classifiable in headings 6901-6903;
   (b) Articles heated <800°C for curing resins, accelerating hydration reactions, or removing water/volatile components are NOT considered "fired" and are EXCLUDED from this chapter;
   (c) Ceramic articles are obtained by firing inorganic, nonmetallic materials previously prepared and shaped (generally at room temperature). Raw materials: clays, siliceous materials (including fused silica), high melting point materials (oxides, carbides, nitrides, graphite, other carbon), and sometimes binders (refractory clays, phosphates).

2. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Products of heading 2844;
   (b) Articles of heading 6804;
   (c) Articles of chapter 71 (e.g., imitation jewelry);
   (d) Cermets (heading 8113);
   (e) Articles of chapter 82;
   (f) Electrical insulators (heading 8546) or fittings of insulating material (heading 8547);
   (g) Artificial teeth (heading 9021);
   (h) Articles of chapter 91 (e.g., clocks and clock cases);
   (ij) Articles of chapter 94 (e.g., furniture, luminaires, lighting fittings, prefabricated buildings);
   (k) Articles of chapter 95 (e.g., toys, games, sports equipment);
   (l) Articles of heading 9606 (buttons) or heading 9614 (smoking pipes);
   (m) Articles of chapter 97 (works of art).

Statistical Notes:
1. "Heat insulating" articles (headings 6904, 6905) = articles with specific gravity ≤1.2, designed to impede or resist heat flow at temperatures >870°C.

2. For heading 6904:
   (a) "Solid bricks" = bricks with ≤25% voids;
   (b) "Hollow bricks" = bricks with >25% voids.
