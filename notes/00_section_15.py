SECTION XV - BASE METALS AND ARTICLES OF BASE METAL

Notes:
1. This section does NOT cover:
   (a) Prepared paints, inks, or other products with metallic flakes/powder basis (headings 3207-3210, 3212, 3213, 3215);
   (b) Ferrocerium or other pyrophoric alloys (heading 3606);
   (c) Headgear or parts (heading 6506 or 6507);
   (d) Umbrella frames or other articles (heading 6603);
   (e) Goods of chapter 71 (precious metal alloys, base metal clad with precious metal, imitation jewelry);
   (f) Articles of section XVI (machinery, mechanical appliances, electrical goods);
   (g) Assembled railway or tramway track (heading 8608) or other section XVII articles (vehicles, ships, boats, aircraft);
   (h) Instruments or apparatus of section XVIII (including clock or watch springs);
   (ij) Lead shot for ammunition (heading 9306) or other section XIX articles (arms and ammunition);
   (k) Articles of chapter 94 (furniture, mattress supports, luminaires, lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings);
   (l) Articles of chapter 95 (toys, games, sports equipment);
   (m) Hand sieves, buttons, pens, pencil-holders, pen nibs, monopods, bipods, tripods, similar articles, or other chapter 96 articles;
   (n) Articles of chapter 97 (works of art).

2. "PARTS OF GENERAL USE" throughout tariff schedule:
   (a) Articles of heading 7307, 7312, 7315, 7317, 7318 and similar articles of other base metal, other than articles exclusively for medical/surgical/dental/veterinary implants (heading 9021);
   (b) Springs and leaves for springs of base metal, other than clock/watch springs (heading 9114);
   (c) Articles of heading 8301, 8302, 8308, 8310 and frames and mirrors of base metal (heading 8306).

3. In chapters 73-76 and 78-82 (but NOT heading 7315): references to parts do not include parts of general use.

4. Subject to paragraph 3 and chapter 83 note 1: articles of chapter 82 or 83 are excluded from chapters 72-76 and 78-81.

5. "BASE METALS" throughout schedule: iron and steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten (wolfram), molybdenum, tantalum, magnesium, cobalt, bismuth, cadmium, titanium, zirconium, antimony, manganese, beryllium, chromium, germanium, vanadium, gallium, hafnium, indium, niobium (columbium), rhenium, thallium.

6. "CERMETS" throughout schedule = products with microscopic heterogeneous combination of metallic and ceramic components. Includes sintered metal carbides (metal carbides sintered with metal).

7. ALLOY CLASSIFICATION (other than ferroalloys and master alloys of chapters 72 and 74):
   (a) Alloy of base metals → classify as alloy of metal predominating by weight over each other metal;
   (b) Alloy of base metals (this section) + elements not in this section → treat as base metal alloy if total weight of such metals ≥ total weight of other elements;
   (c) "Alloys" includes sintered mixtures of metal powders, heterogeneous intimate mixtures from melting (other than cermets), and intermetallic compounds.

8. Unless context requires otherwise, "base metal" in tariff schedule includes alloys classified as alloys of that metal per note 7.

9. COMPOSITE ARTICLES CLASSIFICATION: unless headings require otherwise, base metal articles (including mixed materials treated as base metal per GRI) containing two or more base metals → treat as articles of the base metal predominating by weight. For this purpose:
   (a) Iron and steel (or different kinds of iron or steel) = one and same metal;
   (b) Alloy = regarded as entirely composed of that metal as alloy of which it is classified per note 5;
   (c) Cermet of heading 8113 = regarded as single base metal.

10. DEFINITIONS:
    (a) "Waste and scrap" = (i) all metal waste and scrap; (ii) metal goods definitely not usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear, or other reasons;
    (b) "Powders" = products where ≥90% by weight passes through 1 mm mesh aperture sieve.

11. For chapters 74-76 and 78-81, DEFINITIONS:
    (a) "Bars and rods" = rolled, extruded, drawn, or forged products, not in coils, with uniform solid cross section along whole length (circles, ovals, rectangles including squares, equilateral triangles, regular convex polygons including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles"). For rectangular (including modified rectangular) cross section: thickness >1/10 of width. Also covers cast or sintered products of same forms/dimensions subsequently worked (otherwise than simple trimming or de-scaling), provided they don't assume character of other heading articles. Wire bars and billets with tapered ends for machine entry → unwrought copper (heading 7403).

    (b) "Profiles" = rolled, extruded, drawn, forged, or formed products (coiled or not), uniform cross section along whole length, not conforming to bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes, or pipes definitions. Also covers cast or sintered products subsequently worked.

    (c) "Wire" = rolled, extruded, or drawn products IN COILS, with uniform solid cross section along whole length (circles, ovals, rectangles including squares, equilateral triangles, regular convex polygons). For rectangular (including modified rectangular) cross section: thickness >1/10 of width.

    (d) "Plates, sheets, strip and foil" = flat-surfaced products (other than unwrought), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross section (including "modified rectangles"), uniform thickness:
        - Rectangular (including square) shape: thickness ≤1/10 of width;
        - Other shapes: any size, provided they don't assume character of other heading articles.
        Includes products with patterns from rolling (grooves, ribs, checkers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and perforated, corrugated, polished, or coated products (provided they don't assume other heading character).

    (e) "Tubes and pipes" = hollow products, coiled or not, with uniform cross section having only one enclosed void along whole length (circles, ovals, rectangles including squares, equilateral triangles, regular convex polygons), uniform wall thickness. Inner and outer cross sections must be concentric and same form/orientation for rectangular/triangular/polygonal cross sections. May be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped, or fitted with flanges, collars, or rings.

Additional U.S. Note:
"Unwrought" = metal (whether or not refined) in form of ingots, blocks, lumps, billets, cakes, slabs, pigs, cathodes, anodes, briquettes, cubes, sticks, grains, sponge, pellets, flattened pellets, rounds, rondelles, shot and similar primary forms. Does NOT cover rolled, forged, drawn, extruded products, tubular products, or cast/sintered forms machined or processed otherwise than by simple trimming, scalping, or descaling.
