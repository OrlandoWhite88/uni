2. TEXTILE MATERIAL MIXTURES (chapters 50-55, heading 5809, 5902):
   (A) Classify as if consisting wholly of the textile material predominating by weight over each other single textile material. If no one predominates, classify by the material covered by the last numerical heading.
   (B) For this rule:
       (a) Gimped horsehair yarn (heading 5110) and metalized yarn (heading 5605) = single textile material (weight = aggregate of components); metal thread = textile material for woven fabric classification;
       (b) Choose heading by determining first the chapter, then the heading within that chapter (disregarding materials not in that chapter);
       (c) Chapters 54 and 55 treated as single chapter when both involved with any other chapter;
       (d) Where chapter or heading refers to goods of different textile materials, treat as single textile material.
   (C) Paragraphs (A) and (B) also apply to yarns in notes 3, 4, 5, or 6.

14. Unless context requires otherwise, textile garments of different headings are classified in their own headings even if put up in sets for retail sale. "Textile garments" = garments of headings 6101-6114 and 6201-6211.

15. Subject to section XI note 1, textiles, garments and other textile articles incorporating chemical, mechanical or electronic components for additional functionality (whether built-in or within fiber/fabric) are classified in their respective section XI headings PROVIDED they retain essential character of section XI goods.

Subheading Notes:
1. YARN DEFINITIONS:
   (a) "Unbleached yarn" = yarn with natural constituent fiber color, not bleached/dyed/printed; OR "grey yarn" of indeterminate color from garnetted stock. May have colorless dressing or fugitive dye (disappears after simple soap washing); man-made fibers may have delustering agents (e.g., titanium dioxide).
   (b) "Bleached yarn" = yarn: (i) bleached, or made of bleached fibers, or dyed white/treated with white dressing (unless context requires otherwise); (ii) mixture of unbleached and bleached fibers; (iii) multiple/cabled of unbleached and bleached yarns.
   (c) "Colored (dyed or printed) yarn" = yarn: (i) dyed other than white or in fugitive color, or printed, or made from dyed/printed fibers; (ii) mixture of dyed fibers of different colors, or mixture of unbleached/bleached fibers with colored fibers (marl or mixture yarns), or printed at intervals to give impression of dots; (iii) from printed slivers or rovings; (iv) multiple/cabled of unbleached/bleached yarn and colored yarn.
   These definitions apply mutatis mutandis to monofilament and strip of chapter 54.

   (d-h) WOVEN FABRIC DEFINITIONS: "Unbleached", "bleached", "dyed", "woven fabric of yarns of different colors", "printed woven fabric" - defined based on yarn composition and processing. These definitions apply mutatis mutandis to knitted or crocheted fabrics.

   (ij) "Plain weave" = fabric construction where each weft yarn passes alternately over and under successive warp yarns, and each warp yarn passes alternately over and under successive weft yarns.

2. TEXTILE MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION (chapters 56-63):
   (A) Products containing two or more textile materials → regarded as consisting wholly of the textile material that would be selected under section XI note 2 for chapters 50-55 or heading 5809 classification.
   (B) For this rule:
       (a) Consider only the part determining classification under GRI 3;
       (b) For pile or looped surface fabrics on ground fabric, disregard ground fabric;
       (c) For embroidery (heading 5810) and goods thereof, consider only ground fabric. Embroidery without visible ground → classified by embroidering threads alone.
