Subheading Note:
"Refined lead" = metal with ≥99.9% lead by weight, PROVIDED each other element does not exceed specified limits:
Ag≤0.02%, As≤0.005%, Bi≤0.05%, Ca≤0.002%, Cd≤0.002%, Cu≤0.08%, Fe≤0.002%, S≤0.002%, Sb≤0.005%, Sn≤0.005%, Zn≤0.002%, others (e.g., Te) each≤0.001%.

Statistical Note:
"Alloys of lead" = metals where lead content is <99% by weight but not less than any other metallic element by weight.
