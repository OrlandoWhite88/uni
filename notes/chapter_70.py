Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Goods of heading 3207 (e.g., vitrifiable enamels and glazes, glass frit, other glass as powder, granules, or flakes);
   (b) Articles of chapter 71 (e.g., imitation jewelry);
   (c) Optical fiber cables (heading 8544), electrical insulators (heading 8546), or fittings of insulating material (heading 8547);
   (d) Front windscreens, rear windows, other windows, framed, for vehicles of chapters 86-88;
   (e) Front windscreens, rear windows, other windows (whether or not framed) incorporating heating devices or other electrical/electronic devices, for vehicles of chapters 86-88;
   (f) Optical fibers, optically worked optical elements, hypodermic syringes, artificial eyes, thermometers, barometers, hydrometers, or other articles of chapter 90;
   (g) Luminaires or lighting fittings, illuminated signs, illuminated name-plates, or the like with permanently fixed light source, or parts thereof (heading 9405);
   (h) Toys, games, sports equipment, Christmas tree ornaments, or other articles of chapter 95 (EXCEPT glass eyes without mechanisms for dolls or chapter 95 articles);

2. For headings 7003, 7004, 7005:
   (a) Glass is NOT regarded as "worked" by reason of any process before annealing;
   (b) Cutting to shape does NOT affect classification of glass in sheets;
   (c) "Absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting layer" = microscopically thin coating of metal or chemical compound (e.g., metal oxide) which absorbs (e.g., infrared light), OR improves reflecting qualities while allowing transparency/translucency, OR prevents light reflection on glass surface.

3. Products of heading 7006 remain classified there whether or not they have character of articles.

4. "Glass wool" (heading 7019):
   (a) Mineral wools with SiO₂ content ≥60% by weight; OR
   (b) Mineral wools with SiO₂ content <60% but with alkaline oxide (K₂O or Na₂O) content >5% by weight OR borix oxide (B₂O₃) content >2% by weight.
   
   Mineral wools not meeting these specifications → heading 6806.

5. "Glass" throughout tariff schedule includes fused quartz and other fused silica.

Subheading Note:
"Lead crystal" (subheadings 7013.22, 7013.33, 7013.41, 7013.91) = ONLY glass with minimum lead monoxide (PbO) content of 24% by weight.

Statistical Notes:
1. For headings 7003 and 7004: when determining surface area of cast or rolled glass with irregular surfaces (e.g., corrugated glass), use superficial area.

2. "Over-the-door mirrors" (statistical reporting numbers 7009.91.5091, 7009.92.5091) = mirrors designed to be affixed to a door or hung from door top by means of hooks attached to or packaged with mirrors at importation. May have brackets or other hardware attached or in packaging.
