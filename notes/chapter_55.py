CHAPTER 55 - MAN-MADE STAPLE FIBERS

Note:
Headings 5501 and 5502 apply ONLY to man-made filament tow consisting of parallel filaments of uniform length equal to tow length, meeting ALL:
(a) Length >2 m;
(b) Twist <5 turns per meter;
(c) Per filament <67 decitex;
(d) Synthetic filament tow only: must be drawn (incapable of being stretched >100% of length);
(e) Total measurement >20,000 decitex.

Tow ≤2 m length → heading 5503 or 5504.

Additional U.S. Note:
For woven fabrics of chapter 55: unless context requires otherwise, provisions for one or more weaves embrace only fabrics (excluding selvage) wholly of specified weave(s).

Statistical Notes - Woven fabric definitions:
(a) "Poplin or broadcloth" = plain weave, not square construction, whether or not napped. EXCLUDES: fabrics ≤170 g/m² with ≤33 warp ends and filling picks per cm²; fabrics >170 g/m² of average yarn number 26 or lower.

(b) "Sheeting" = plain weave, whether or not napped:
    (i) ≤170 g/m², square construction, >33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², average yarn number 68 or lower (excluding printcloth);
    (ii) >170 g/m², EXCLUDING: fabrics with multiple/cabled warp or filling of average yarn number 26 or lower; fabrics of average yarn number 27+ not of square construction.

(c) "Printcloth" = plain weave, ≤170 g/m², average yarn numbers 43-68, >33 singles yarns per cm², no multiple/cabled yarns, square construction, whether or not napped: (i) not combed; (ii) other fabrics <168 cm width.

(d) "Cheesecloth" = plain weave, ≤170 g/m², ≤33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², whether or not napped.

(e) "Lawns, voiles or batistes" = plain weave, ≤170 g/m², average yarn number 69+, >33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², square construction, whether or not napped.

(f) "Duck" = >170 g/m², average yarn number 26 or lower, whether or not napped: (i) plain weave with multiple/cabled warp or filling; OR (ii) taped warp (NOT classified as plain weave).

(g) "Oxford cloth" = ≤170 g/m², whether or not napped, taped warp. NOT classified as plain weave.

(h) "Blue denim" = >170 g/m², 3-thread or 4-thread twill (including broken twill), warp faced, blue-dyed warp, weft unbleached/bleached/dyed grey/lighter blue.

(ij) "Square construction": (i) <79 warp ends and filling picks per cm², difference <11; OR (ii) ≥79, each count <57% of total.

(k) "Napped" = fuzzy, fibrous surface. NOT pile fabrics.

(l) "Not combed" = fabrics partly of uncombed cotton, other vegetable textile fibers, wool, or fine animal hair.

(m) "Combed" = fabrics containing combed fibers.

(n) "Number" = average yarn number. Formula: N = BYT/1000, 100T/Z', BT/Z or ST/10. Disregard fractions.

"Discharge printed" = fabrics: (a) dyed single uniform color (not white); (b) processed with color-destroying chemicals to discharge dye, then printed; (c) subjected to 2+ finishing operations.
