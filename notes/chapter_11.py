CHAPTER 11 - PRODUCTS OF THE MILLING INDUSTRY; MALT; STARCHES; INULIN; WHEAT GLUTEN

Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Roasted malt put up as coffee substitutes (heading 0901 or 2101);
   (b) Prepared flours, groats, meals or starches of heading 1901;
   (c) Corn flakes or other products of heading 1904;
   (d) Vegetables, prepared or preserved, of heading 2001, 2004 or 2005;
   (e) Pharmaceutical products (chapter 30);
   (f) Starches having character of perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations (chapter 33).

2. (A) Cereal milling products fall in this chapter if by weight on dry product:
   (a) Starch content (modified Ewers polarimetric method) EXCEEDS values below; AND
   (b) Ash content (after deduction of added minerals) does NOT EXCEED values below.
   Otherwise → heading 2302. Exception: cereal germ (whole, rolled, flaked, ground) always → heading 1104.

   (B) Products meeting above conditions classify in heading 1101 or 1102 if passage through sieve with indicated aperture is NOT LESS than shown percentage.
   Otherwise → heading 1103 or 1104.

   CEREAL CLASSIFICATION TABLE:
   | Cereal              | Starch % | Ash % | 315μm sieve | 500μm sieve |
   |---------------------|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
   | Wheat and rye       | >45      | ≤2.5  | ≥80%        | -           |
   | Barley              | >45      | ≤3    | ≥80%        | -           |
   | Oats                | >45      | ≤5    | ≥80%        | -           |
   | Corn/grain sorghum  | >45      | ≤2    | -           | ≥90%        |
   | Rice                | >45      | ≤1.6  | ≥80%        | -           |
   | Buckwheat           | >45      | ≤4    | ≥80%        | -           |

3. For heading 1103, "groats" and "meal" = products from cereal grain fragmentation where:
   (a) Corn (maize): ≥95% by weight passes through 2mm sieve;
   (b) Other cereals: ≥95% by weight passes through 1.25mm sieve.
