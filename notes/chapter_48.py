3. Subject to note 7, headings 4801-4805 include paper/paperboard: calendered, super-calendered, glazed, similarly finished, false water-marked, surface sized; and paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding, cellulose fiber webs colored or marbled throughout the mass. Except heading 4803: do NOT apply if otherwise processed.

4. "Newsprint" = uncoated paper for newspaper printing, where ≥50% by weight of total fiber is wood fibers from mechanical or chemi-mechanical process, unsized or very lightly sized, Parker Print Surf surface roughness >2.5 μm each side (1 MPa), weight 40-65 g/m². Applies only to: (a) strips or rolls width >28 cm; OR (b) rectangular sheets with one side >28 cm and other >15 cm (unfolded).

5. "Paper and paperboard, of a kind used for writing, printing or other graphic purposes" and "nonperforated punch-cards and punch tape paper" (heading 4802) = paper/paperboard mainly from bleached pulp or mechanical/chemi-mechanical pulp satisfying criteria in (A) for ≤150 g/m² or (B) for >150 g/m², based on fiber content, ash content, brightness, burst index, caliper. EXCLUDES: filter paper/paperboard (including teabag paper), felt paper/paperboard.

6. "Kraft paper and paperboard" = paper/paperboard where ≥80% by weight of total fiber is fibers from chemical sulfate or soda processes.

7. Paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding, cellulose fiber webs answering to descriptions in two or more of headings 4801-4811 → classify in LAST numerical heading.

8. Headings 4803-4809 apply ONLY to paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding, cellulose fiber webs:
   (a) In strips or rolls width >36 cm; OR
   (b) In rectangular sheets with one side >36 cm and other >15 cm (unfolded).

9. "Wallpaper and similar wall coverings" (heading 4814):
   (a) Paper in rolls, width 45-160 cm, for wall/ceiling decoration:
       (i) Grained, embossed, surface-colored, design-printed, or otherwise surface-decorated (with textile flock), whether or not with transparent protective plastics;
       (ii) With uneven surface from incorporated wood, straw, etc. particles;
       (iii) Face side coated/covered with plastics (grained, embossed, colored, design-printed, or otherwise decorated);
       (iv) Face side covered with plaiting material (whether or not bound together in parallel strands or woven);
   (b) Borders and friezes of paper (treated as above), whether or not in rolls, for wall/ceiling decoration;
   (c) Wall coverings of paper in panels (rolls or sheets) printed to make scene, design, or motif when applied to wall.

10. Products on paper/paperboard base suitable for both floor and wall covering → heading 4823.

11. Heading 4820 does NOT cover loose sheets or cards, cut to size, whether or not printed, embossed, or perforated.

12. Heading 4823 includes: perforated paper/paperboard cards for Jacquard or similar machines; paper lace.

13. Except headings 4814 or 4821: paper, paperboard, cellulose wadding and articles printed with motifs, characters, or pictorial representations not merely subsidiary to primary use → chapter 49.

Subheading Notes:
