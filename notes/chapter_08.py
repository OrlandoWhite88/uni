CHAPTER 8 - EDIBLE FRUIT AND NUTS; PEEL OF CITRUS FRUIT OR MELONS

Notes:
1. This chapter does NOT cover inedible nuts or fruit.

2. Chilled fruit/nuts classify in same headings as corresponding fresh fruit/nuts.

3. Dried fruit/nuts may be partially rehydrated or treated for:
   (a) Additional preservation/stabilization (e.g., moderate heat treatment, sulfuring, sorbic acid/potassium sorbate addition);
   (b) Improving/maintaining appearance (e.g., vegetable oil addition, small quantities of glucose syrup);
   - PROVIDED they retain dried fruit/nut character.

4. Heading 0812: fruit/nuts treated solely for provisional preservation during transport/storage (e.g., sulfur dioxide gas, brine, sulfur water, other preservative solutions) - must remain unsuitable for immediate consumption in that state.
