   (ij) Searchlights or spotlights (heading 9405);
   (k) Articles of chapter 95;
   (l) Monopods, bipods, tripods, and similar (heading 9620);
   (m) Capacity measures (classified by constituent material);
   (n) Spools, reels, or similar supports (classified by constituent material, e.g., heading 3923 or section XV).

2. PARTS AND ACCESSORIES classification:
   (a) Parts and accessories which are goods of any chapter 84, 85, or 91 heading (other than 8487, 8548, 9033) → classify in their respective headings;
   (b) Other parts and accessories for use solely or principally with particular kind of machine, instrument, or apparatus (including heading 9010, 9013, 9031) → classify with those machines, instruments, or apparatus;
   (c) All other parts and accessories → heading 9033.

3. Section XVI notes 3 and 4 also apply to this chapter.

4. Heading 9005 does NOT apply to telescopic sights for arms, periscopic telescopes for submarines or tanks, or telescopes for machines, appliances, instruments, or apparatus of this chapter or section XVI; such telescopic sights and telescopes → heading 9013.

5. Measuring or checking optical instruments, appliances, or machines classifiable in both heading 9013 and 9031 → heading 9031.

6. "Orthopedic appliances" (heading 9021) = appliances for:
   (a) Preventing or correcting bodily deformities;
   (b) Supporting or holding parts of body following illness, operation, or injury.
   Includes footwear and special insoles for orthopedic conditions, PROVIDED they are: (1) made to measure; OR (2) mass-produced, entered singly (not in pairs), and designed to fit either foot equally.

7. Heading 9032 applies ONLY to:
   (a) Instruments and apparatus for automatically controlling flow, level, pressure, or other variables of liquids or gases, or for automatically controlling temperature (whether or not operation depends on electrical phenomenon varying according to controlled factor), designed to bring factor to and maintain at desired value, stabilized against disturbances, by constantly or periodically measuring actual value;
   (b) Automatic regulators of electrical quantities, and instruments or apparatus for automatically controlling non-electrical quantities (operation depending on electrical phenomenon varying according to controlled factor), designed to bring factor to and maintain at desired value.

Additional U.S. Notes:
1. "Optically worked" (headings 9001, 9002) = glass surface ground or polished to produce required optical properties.
2. "Electrical" (for instruments, appliances, apparatus, machines) = operation depends on electrical phenomenon varying according to factor to be ascertained.
3. "Optical appliances" and "optical instruments" = ONLY those incorporating one or more optical elements, but NOT appliances or instruments where optical elements are solely for viewing scale or other subsidiary purpose.
4. "Printed circuit assembly" = goods of one or more printed circuits (heading 8534) with one or more active elements (diodes, transistors, similar semiconductor devices of heading 8541, and integrated circuits of heading 8542) assembled thereon, with or without passive elements.
