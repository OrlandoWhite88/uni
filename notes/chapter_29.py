CHAPTER 29 - ORGANIC CHEMICALS

Notes:
1. Unless context requires otherwise, chapter headings apply only to:
   (a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds (whether or not with impurities);
   (b) Mixtures of two or more isomers of same organic compound (whether or not with impurities), EXCEPT acyclic hydrocarbon isomer mixtures (other than stereoisomers) → chapter 27;
   (c) Products of headings 2936-2939, sugar ethers/acetals/esters and salts (heading 2940), products of heading 2941 (whether or not chemically defined);
   (d) Products of (a)-(c) dissolved in water;
   (e) Products of (a)-(c) dissolved in other solvents, IF solution is normal/necessary for safety/transport AND solvent doesn't render product suitable for specific use;
   (f) Products of (a)-(e) with added stabilizer (including anticaking agent) for preservation/transport;
   (g) Products of (a)-(f) with anti-dusting/coloring/odoriferous substance or emetic for identification/safety, PROVIDED additions don't render product suitable for specific use;
   (h) Diazonium salts, couplers, diazotizable amines and salts - diluted to standard strengths for azo dye production.

2. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Goods of heading 1504 or crude glycerol (heading 1520);
   (b) Ethyl alcohol (heading 2207 or 2208);
   (c) Methane or propane (heading 2711);
   (d) Carbon compounds of chapter 28 note 2;
   (e) Immunological products (heading 3002);
   (f) Urea (heading 3102 or 3105);
   (g) Vegetable/animal coloring matter (heading 3203); synthetic organic coloring matter, fluorescent brightening agents, luminophores (heading 3204); retail dyes/coloring matter (heading 3212);
   (h) Enzymes (heading 3507);
   (ij) Metaldehyde, hexamethylenetetramine or similar as fuel forms (tablets/sticks) or liquid/liquefied-gas fuels in lighter containers ≤300cm³ (heading 3606);
   (k) Fire-extinguisher charges/grenades (heading 3813); retail ink removers (heading 3824);
   (l) Optical elements of ethylenediamine tartrate (heading 9001).

3. Goods classifiable in two or more chapter headings → classify in LAST numerical heading.

4. Headings 2904-2906, 2908-2911, 2913-2920: "halogenated, sulfonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives" includes compound derivatives (sulfohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulfonated, nitrosulfohalogenated).

5. Nitro/nitroso groups are NOT "nitrogen-functions" for heading 2929.

6. "Oxygen function" (headings 2911, 2912, 2914, 2918, 2922) = restricted to oxygen-functions of headings 2905-2920.

7. Ester classification:
   (A) Esters of acid-function compounds (subchapters I-VII) with organic compounds of subchapters I-VII → classify in LAST numerical heading;
   (B) Ethyl alcohol esters with acid-function compounds (subchapters I-VII) → classify with corresponding acid-function compound;
   (C) Subject to section VI note 1 and chapter 28 note 2:
       (1) Inorganic salts of organic compounds (acid/phenol/enol-function or organic bases) of subchapters I-X or heading 2942 → classify with organic compound heading;
       (2) Salts between organic compounds of subchapters I-X or heading 2942 → classify with base or acid (including phenol/enol-function) that occurs LAST numerically;
       (3) Coordination compounds (other than subchapter XI or heading 2941 products) → classify in LAST numerical heading appropriate to fragments from cleaving all metal bonds (except metal-carbon bonds);
   (D) Metal alcoholates → classify with corresponding alcohols (except ethanol → heading 2905);
   (E) Carboxylic acid halides → classify with corresponding acids.

8. Headings 2930/2931 (organo-sulfur/organo-inorganic compounds): molecules with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen PLUS other nonmetals or metals (sulfur, arsenic, lead) directly linked to carbon. EXCLUDES: sulfonated/halogenated derivatives with only sulfur or halogen directly linked to carbon.

9. Headings 2932, 2933, 2934 EXCLUDE: epoxides (3-membered ring), ketone peroxides, cyclic aldehyde/thioaldehyde polymers, polybasic carboxylic acid anhydrides, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols/phenols with polybasic acids, polybasic acid imides - applies only when ring-position hetero-atoms result solely from listed cyclizing functions.

10. "Hormones" (heading 2937):
    (a) Includes hormone-releasing/stimulating factors, inhibitors, antagonists (antihormones);
    (b) "Used primarily as hormones" includes derivatives/structural analogues for hormonal effect OR as synthesis intermediates.

Subheading Notes:
1. Derivatives of chemical compounds → classify in same subheading as parent compound, unless more specifically covered elsewhere or residual "Other" subheading exists.
2. Chapter 29 note 3 does NOT apply to subheadings.
