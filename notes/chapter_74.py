CHAPTER 74 - COPPER AND ARTICLES THEREOF

Note:
(a) "Refined copper" = metal with ≥99.85% copper by weight; OR metal with ≥97.5% copper by weight, PROVIDED each other element does not exceed specified limits (Ag≤0.25%, As≤0.5%, Cd≤1.3%, Cr≤1.4%, Mg≤0.8%, Pb≤1.5%, S≤0.7%, Sn≤0.8%, Te≤0.8%, Zn≤1%, Zr≤0.3%, others each≤0.3%).

(b) "Copper alloys" = metallic substances (other than unrefined copper) where copper predominates by weight over each other element, PROVIDED:
    (i) At least one other element exceeds limit in refined copper table; OR
    (ii) Total content of such other elements >2.5%.

(c) "Master alloys" = alloys with >10% copper by weight plus other elements, not usefully malleable, commonly used as additive in alloy manufacture or as deoxidants, desulfurizing agents, or similar uses in nonferrous metallurgy. HOWEVER: copper phosphide (phosphor copper) with >15% phosphorus → heading 2853.

Subheading Note:
(a) "Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses)" = copper and zinc alloys, with or without other elements. When other elements present: zinc predominates over each; nickel <5% by weight (see nickel silvers); tin <3% by weight (see bronzes).

(b) "Copper-tin base alloys (bronzes)" = copper and tin alloys, with or without other elements. When other elements present: tin predominates over each, EXCEPT when tin ≥3%, zinc may exceed tin but must be <10%.

(c) "Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers)" = copper, nickel, and zinc alloys, with or without other elements. Nickel ≥5% by weight (see brasses).

(d) "Copper-nickel base alloys" = copper and nickel alloys, with or without other elements but ≤1% zinc. When other elements present: nickel predominates over each.

Additional U.S. Note:
Deduction in additional U.S. note 1 to chapter 26 applies to cement copper and copper precipitates (subheading 7401.20).

Statistical Note:
"Beryllium copper master alloy" = master alloys with 3-10% beryllium by weight.
