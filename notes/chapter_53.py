CHAPTER 53 - OTHER VEGETABLE TEXTILE FIBERS; PAPER YARN AND WOVEN FABRICS OF PAPER YARN

Statistical Note - Woven fabric definitions:
(a) Unless context requires otherwise, provisions relating to one or more weaves embrace only fabrics (excluding selvage) wholly of specified weave(s), including combinations exclusively thereof.

(b) "Poplin or broadcloth" = plain weave, not square construction, whether or not napped. EXCLUDES: fabrics ≤200 g/m² with ≤33 warp ends and filling picks per cm²; fabrics >200 g/m² of average yarn number 26 or lower.

(c) "Sheeting" = plain weave, whether or not napped:
    (i) ≤200 g/m², square construction, >33 warp ends and filling picks per cm², average yarn number 68 or lower (excluding printcloth);
    (ii) >200 g/m², EXCLUDING: fabrics with multiple/cabled warp or filling of average yarn number 26 or lower; fabrics of average yarn number 27+ not of square construction.

(d) "Printcloth" = plain weave, ≤200 g/m², average yarn numbers 43-68, >33 singles yarns per cm², no multiple/cabled yarns, square construction, not combed, whether or not napped.

(e) "Square construction":
    (i) <79 warp ends and filling picks per cm², difference between warp ends/cm and filling picks/cm is <11; OR
    (ii) ≥79 warp ends and filling picks per cm², where each count is <57% of total count per cm².

(f) "Napped" = fuzzy, fibrous surface from scratching/pricking surface to raise fibers from yarn body. NOT pile fabrics.

(g) "Not combed" = fabrics wholly or partly of uncombed cotton, other vegetable textile fibers, wool, or fine animal hair.

(h) "Combed" = fabrics containing combed cotton, other vegetable textile fibers, wool, or fine animal hair.

(ij) "Number" (woven fabrics of chapter 53) = average yarn number. Computed by measuring yarn length as distance covered in fabric as imported (clipped yarn measured as if continuous), counting total single yarns (including singles in multiple/cabled yarns), weight taken after removing excessive sizing. Formulas: N = BYT/1000, 100T/Z', BT/Z or ST/10 (where N=average yarn number, B=breadth in cm, Y=meters per kg, T=total single yarns per cm², S=m² per kg, Z=g per linear meter, Z'=g per m²). Disregard fractions.
