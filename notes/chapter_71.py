CHAPTER 71 - NATURAL OR CULTURED PEARLS, PRECIOUS OR SEMIPRECIOUS STONES, PRECIOUS METALS, METALS CLAD WITH PRECIOUS METAL, AND ARTICLES THEREOF; IMITATION JEWELRY; COIN

Notes:
1. Subject to section VI note 1(a) and except as provided below, all articles consisting wholly or partly of:
   (a) Natural or cultured pearls, or precious or semiprecious stones (natural, synthetic, or reconstructed); OR
   (b) Precious metal or metal clad with precious metal;
   are classified in this chapter.

2. (a) Headings 7113, 7114, 7115 do NOT cover articles where precious metal or metal clad with precious metal is present as minor constituents only (e.g., minor fittings or ornamentation like monograms, ferrules, rims); note 1(b) does not apply to such articles.
   (b) Heading 7116 does NOT cover articles containing precious metal or metal clad with precious metal (other than as minor constituents).

3. This chapter does NOT cover:
   (a) Amalgams of precious metal or colloidal precious metal (heading 2843);
   (b) Sterile surgical suture materials, dental fillings, or other goods of chapter 30;
   (c) Goods of chapter 32 (e.g., lustres);
   (d) Supported catalysts (heading 3815);

4. DEFINITIONS:
   (a) "Precious metal" = silver, gold, platinum;
   (b) "Platinum" = platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium;
   (c) "Precious or semiprecious stones" EXCLUDES substances in chapter 96 note 2(b).

5. PRECIOUS METAL ALLOYS: any alloy (including sintered mixture and inter-metallic compound) containing precious metal is treated as precious metal alloy if any one precious metal constitutes ≥2% by weight. Classification:
   (a) ≥2% platinum → alloy of platinum;
   (b) ≥2% gold but no platinum, or <2% platinum → alloy of gold;
   (c) Other alloys ≥2% silver → alloy of silver.

6. Unless context requires otherwise, "precious metal" or any particular precious metal in tariff schedule includes alloys treated as alloys of precious metal per note 5, but NOT metal clad with precious metal or base metal/non-metals plated with precious metal.

7. "Metal clad with precious metal" = material with base metal base having precious metal covering affixed by soldering, brazing, welding, hot-rolling, or similar mechanical means on one or more surfaces. Also covers base metal inlaid with precious metal (unless context requires otherwise).

8. Subject to section VI note 1(a), goods matching heading 7112 → classify in that heading ONLY (no other tariff heading).

9. "Articles of jewelry" (heading 7113):
   (a) Small objects of personal adornment (rings, bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings, watch chains, fobs, pendants, tie pins, cuff links, dress studs, religious or other medals and insignia);
   (b) Articles of personal use normally carried in pocket, handbag, or on person (cigar/cigarette cases, snuff boxes, cachou or pill boxes, powder boxes, chain purses, prayer beads).
   May be combined/set with natural or cultured pearls, precious or semiprecious stones (natural, synthetic, reconstructed), tortoise shell, mother-of-pearl, ivory, natural or reconstituted amber, jet, or coral.

10. "Articles of goldsmiths' or silversmiths' wares" (heading 7114) = ornaments, tableware, toilet-ware, smokers' articles, and other articles of household, office, or religious use.

11.

Subheading Notes:
1. "Powder" and "in powder form" (subheadings 7106.10, 7108.11, 7110.11, 7110.21, 7110.31, 7110.41) = products where ≥90% by weight passes through 0.5 mm mesh aperture sieve.

2. Notwithstanding note 4(b), "platinum" in subheadings 7110.11 and 7110.19 does NOT include iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, or ruthenium.

3. For heading 7110 subheading alloy classification: each alloy classified with the metal (platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, or ruthenium) that predominates by weight over each other of these metals.

Statistical Notes:
1. "ISO standard platinum" (subheading 7113.19.50) = platinum meeting ISO standard containing ≥85% pure platinum OR ≥50% pure platinum with combined ≥95% platinum group metals (iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium).
2. For statistical numbers 7113.19.5021-7113.19.5091: each piece counted individually (e.g., pair of earrings = 2 pieces; necklace and pendant = 1 piece).
