CHAPTER 72 - IRON AND STEEL

Notes (definitions for this chapter and, for (d), (e), (f), throughout tariff schedule):
(a) "Pig iron" = iron-carbon alloys not usefully malleable, >2% carbon by weight, with element limits: ≤10% chromium, ≤6% manganese, ≤3% phosphorus, ≤8% silicon, total ≤10% other elements.

(b) "Spiegeleisen" = iron-carbon alloys with >6% but ≤30% manganese by weight, otherwise conforming to pig iron specification.

(c) "Ferroalloys" = alloys in pigs, blocks, lumps, similar primary forms, continuous cast forms, granular or powder forms (whether or not agglomerated), commonly used as additive in alloy manufacture or as deoxidants, desulfurizing agents, or similar uses in ferrous metallurgy, generally not usefully malleable, with ≥4% iron by weight and one or more of: >10% chromium, >30% manganese, >3% phosphorus, >8% silicon, total >10% other elements (excluding carbon, max 10% copper).

(d) "Steel" = ferrous materials other than heading 7203 products, usefully malleable (except certain castings), with ≤2% carbon by weight. Chromium steels may contain higher carbon.

(e) "Stainless steel" = alloy steels with ≤1.2% carbon and ≥10.5% chromium by weight, with or without other elements.

(f) "Other alloy steel" = steels not meeting stainless steel definition, containing by weight one or more of: ≥0.3% aluminum, ≥0.0008% boron, ≥0.3% chromium, ≥0.3% cobalt, ≥0.4% copper, ≥0.4% lead, ≥1.65% manganese, ≥0.08% molybdenum, ≥0.3% nickel, ≥0.06% niobium, ≥0.6% silicon, ≥0.05% titanium, ≥0.3% tungsten (wolfram), ≥0.1% vanadium, ≥0.05% zirconium, ≥0.1% other elements (except S, P, C, N) taken separately.

(g) "Remelting scrap ingots of iron or steel" = products roughly cast as ingots without feeder-heads or hot tops, or as pigs, with obvious surface faults, not complying with pig iron, spiegeleisen, or ferroalloy chemical composition.

(h) "Granules" = products where <90% passes through 1 mm sieve and ≥90% passes through 5 mm sieve by weight.

(ij) "Semifinished products" = continuous cast products of solid section (whether or not subjected to primary hot-rolling); AND other solid section products only subjected to primary hot-rolling or roughly shaped by forging (including blanks for angles, shapes, sections). Not in coils.

(k) "Flat-rolled products" = rolled products of solid rectangular (other than square) cross section, not conforming to (ij), in form of:
    - Coils of successively superimposed layers; OR
    - Straight lengths: thickness <4.75 mm with width ≥10× thickness; OR thickness ≥4.75 mm with width >150 mm and ≥2× thickness.
    Includes products with patterns from rolling (grooves, ribs, checkers, tears, buttons, lozenges), perforated, corrugated, or polished (provided they don't assume other heading character). Non-rectangular/square shapes of any size → classify as width ≥600 mm (provided they don't assume other heading character).

(l) "Bars and rods, hot-rolled, in irregularly wound coils" = hot-rolled products in irregularly wound coils, with solid cross section (circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles including squares, triangles, other convex polygons including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles"). May have indentations, ribs, grooves, or other deformations from rolling (reinforcing bars and rods).

(m) "Other bars and rods" = products not conforming to (ij), (k), (l), or wire definition, with uniform solid cross section along whole length (circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles including squares, triangles, other convex polygons). May have indentations, ribs, grooves from rolling (reinforcing bars) or be twisted after rolling.

(n) "Angles, shapes and sections" = products with uniform solid cross section along whole length not conforming to (ij), (k), (l), (m), or wire definition. Chapter 72 does not include heading 7301 or 7302 products.

(o) "Wire" = cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along whole length, not conforming to flat-rolled products definition.

(p) "Hollow drill bars and rods" = hollow bars and rods of any cross section, suitable for drills, greatest external dimension >15 mm but ≤52 mm, greatest internal dimension ≤half of greatest external dimension. Non-conforming hollow bars and rods → heading 7304.

2. Ferrous metals clad with another ferrous metal → classify as products of the ferrous metal predominating by weight.

3. Iron or steel products obtained by electrolytic deposition, pressure casting, or sintering → classify by form, composition, and appearance in headings appropriate to similar hot-rolled products.
