CHAPTER 76 - ALUMINUM AND ARTICLES THEREOF

Subheading Notes:
(a) "Aluminum, not alloyed" = metal with ≥99% aluminum by weight, PROVIDED each other element does not exceed: Fe+Si≤1%, others each≤0.1% (Cu may be 0.1-0.2% if Cr and Mn each ≤0.05%).

(b) "Aluminum alloys" = metallic substances where aluminum predominates by weight over each other element, PROVIDED:
    (i) At least one other element (or Fe+Si together) exceeds limit in aluminum table; OR
    (ii) Total content of such other elements >1%.

2. Notwithstanding section XV note 9(c), "wire" for subheading 7616.91 = products (whether or not in coils) of any cross-sectional shape, no cross-sectional dimension exceeding 6 mm.

Additional U.S. Note:
For heading 7608: "Free (C)" rate in "Special" subcolumn applies only to tubes and pipes with attached fittings, suitable for conducting gases or liquids.

Statistical Notes:
1. "Aluminum vanadium master alloy" = aluminum alloys with ≥20% vanadium by weight.

2. "Aluminum can stock" = sheets and strip in coils, of aluminum alloys where manganese or magnesium is predominant alloying element, not painted, >0.175 mm but ≤0.432 mm thick, >254 mm wide:
   (a) "Body stock" = manganese predominant, minimum tensile strength 262 MPa;
   (b) "Lid stock" = magnesium predominant, minimum tensile strength 345 MPa.

3. "Sheet ingot" (slabs) (7601.20.9080) = aluminum alloys with rectangular cross-section suitable for manufacture into other products.

4. "Foundry ingot" (7601.20.9085) = large castings of aluminum alloys of various shapes (other than sheets or slabs) to be melted for further processing.

5. "Recyclable aluminum" (subheading 7602.00.00) = materials that are obsolete, previously used, off-specification, surplus, or incidentally produced, collected and sorted for processing into specification-grade commodity. Does NOT include solid waste or residue.

6. "High-strength heat-treatable alloys" (7604.29.3030, 7604.29.5020, 7606.12.3015) = aluminum with ≤7.0% Cu or ≤10.0% Zn, and/or designated series 2xxx or 7xxx (except 7072) per Aluminum Association specifications.

7. "Heat-treatable industrial alloys" (7604.21.0010, 7604.29.1010, 7604.29.3060, 7604.29.5050, 7606.12.3025, 7606.12.3091) = aluminum with ≤3.0% Mg and ≤3.0% Si, and/or designated series 6xxx per Aluminum Association specifications.
