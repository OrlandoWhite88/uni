{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "HS CODE CLASSIFICATION EXPERT SYSTEM\n\nIDENTITY\n\nExpert customs broker with complete HTS mastery, GRI expertise, and extensive \nclassification experience. Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear. Cannot confidently choose \nbetween options at this level without clarification.\n\n0.30-0.39 MINIMAL\nGeneral product category identifiable but specific classification criteria \nmostly unknown. Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear. Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances;

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear.

Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user",

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "HS CODE CLASSIFICATION EXPERT SYSTEM\n\nIDENTITY\n\nExpert customs broker with complete HTS mastery, GRI expertise, and extensive \nclassification experience. Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear. Cannot confidently choose \nbetween options at this level without clarification.\n\n0.30-0.39 MINIMAL\nGeneral product category identifiable but specific classification criteria \nmostly unknown. Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear.

There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user",

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear. Cannot confidently choose \nbetween options at this level without clarification.\n\n0.30-0.39 MINIMAL\nGeneral product category identifiable but specific classification criteria \nmostly unknown. Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear. Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_candidates\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"73 - Articles of iron or steel\", \"classification_tree\": {\"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"7301\", \"description\": \"Sheet piling of iron or steel, whether or not drilled, punched or made from assembled elements;

This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required.

It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"73 - Articles of iron or steel\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Articles of iron or steel\", \"path\": \"73 - Articles of iron or steel\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"7301\", \"description\": \"Sheet piling of iron or steel, whether or not drilled, punched or made from assembled elements;

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation.

When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_chapters\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"count\": 6, \"chapters\": {\"1\": \"Live animals\", \"2\": \"Meat and edible meat offal\", \"3\": \"Fish and crustaceans, molluscs and other aquatic invertebrates\", \"4\": \"Dairy produce;

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide.

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_chapters\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"count\": 3, \"chapters\": {\"73\": \"Articles of iron or steel\", \"84\": \"Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof\", \"87\": \"Vehicles other than railway or tramway rolling stock, and parts and accessories thereof\", \"90\": \"Optical, photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or surgical instruments and apparatus; parts and accessories thereof\", \"95\": \"Toys, games and sports requisites; parts and accessories thereof\", \"98\": \"Special classification provisions\"}, \"stage\": 2, \"stage1_selection\": [{\"chapter\": \"84\", \"initial_score\": 1.0, \"reasoning\": \"Heading 8482 specifically names 'Ball or roller bearings'.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "HS CODE CLASSIFICATION EXPERT SYSTEM\n\nIDENTITY\n\nExpert customs broker with complete HTS mastery, GRI expertise, and extensive \nclassification experience. Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear.

Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear. Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type.

Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation.

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear.

Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear.

The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances;

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide.

Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_candidates\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances;

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question.

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_candidates\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10\", \"description\": \"Ball bearings:\", \"is_group\": false, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"full_description\": \"Radial ball bearings and one-way roller bearings for use in radio-controlled small engines (cars, boats, aircraft).

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2.

They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25).

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "HS CODE CLASSIFICATION EXPERT SYSTEM\n\nIDENTITY\n\nExpert customs broker with complete HTS mastery, GRI expertise, and extensive \nclassification experience. Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear.

Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear. Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals.

They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96.

Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question.

PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide.

Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof:\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof:\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10\", \"description\": \"Ball bearings:\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"full_description\": \"Radial ball bearings and one-way roller bearings for use in radio-controlled small engines (cars, boats, aircraft).

When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"select_candidates\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8483 - Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints); parts thereof:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8483.10\", \"description\": \"Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks:\", \"is_group\": false, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8483.10.5000\", \"full_description\": \"Ball splines consist of a spline shaft and one of four types of spline nuts: key type, flange type, gear-toothed type, or rigid square spline type.

Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question.

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8483 - Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints); parts thereof:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints); parts thereof:\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8483 - Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks; bearing housings, housed bearings and plain shaft bearings; gears and gearing; ball or roller screws; gear boxes and other speed changers, including torque converters; flywheels and pulleys, including pulley blocks; clutches and shaft couplings (including universal joints); parts thereof:\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8483.10\", \"description\": \"Transmission shafts (including camshafts and crankshafts) and cranks:\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": false, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8483.10.5000\", \"full_description\": \"Ball splines consist of a spline shaft and one of four types of spline nuts: key type, flange type, gear-toothed type, or rigid square spline type.

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required.

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044.

When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Ball bearings:\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings:\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10.10\", \"description\": \"Ball bearings with integral shafts\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}, {\"index\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"full_description\": \"Modified angular contact ball bearings used in electromagnetic bearing systems for dampening and load toleration.

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Ball bearings:\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings:\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10.10\", \"description\": \"Ball bearings with integral shafts\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}, {\"index\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8482.10.50\", \"full_description\": \"Modified angular contact ball bearings used in electromagnetic bearing systems for dampening and load toleration.

Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2.

Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96.

This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required.

Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal.

It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.80.00 - Other, including combined ball/roller bearings\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Other, including combined ball/roller bearings\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.80.00 - Other, including combined ball/roller bearings\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.20\", \"description\": \"Combined ball and spherical roller bearings\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": false}, {\"index\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.40\", \"description\": \"Combined ball and needle roller bearings\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}, {\"index\": 3, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.60\", \"description\": \"Combined ball and other cylindrical roller bearings\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}, {\"index\": 4, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.80\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}]}, \"candidates\": [{\"option_number\": 4, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.80\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false}, {\"option_number\": 3, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.60\", \"description\": \"Combined ball and other cylindrical roller bearings\", \"is_group\": false}, {\"option_number\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.80.00.40\", \"description\": \"Combined ball and needle roller bearings\", \"is_group\": false}], \"confidence_threshold\": 0.85}}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"thinking\": \"The current classification path has navigated to subheading 8482.80 ('Other, including combined ball/roller bearings').

The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > [GROUP] Parts:\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Parts:\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > [GROUP] Parts:\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.91.00\", \"description\": \"Balls, needles and rollers\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true, \"cross_rulings\": [{\"hts_code\": \"8482.91.0010\", \"full_description\": \"Alloy steel balls, ball retainer made of nitrile rubber, and stainless steel retainer ring used in swivel joint pipe fittings for allowing swivel function and retaining balls.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "HS CODE CLASSIFICATION EXPERT SYSTEM\n\nIDENTITY\n\nExpert customs broker with complete HTS mastery, GRI expertise, and extensive \nclassification experience. Apply professional judgment, precedent knowledge, \nand strategic decision-making to every classification.\n\nCLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY\n\nThe Harmonized System follows a hierarchical structure:\n- Section: Broad groupings of related chapters (e.g., Section I covers Chapters 1-5 for Live Animals & Animal Products). Section titles are for reference only, not legally binding.\n- Chapter: 2 digits - Major product categories within sections\n- Heading: 4 digits - Product groups within chapters\n- Subheading: 6 digits - Specific product types (internationally standardized to 6 digits)\n- Tariff Line: 8-10 digits - National statistical suffixes\n\nClassification proceeds from general to specific. Each level narrows based on \nproduct characteristics relevant at that level. When comparing subheadings, only \ncompare at the same level (same number of dashes in the tariff).\n\nGENERAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION (GRI)\n\nApply GRIs in order. Only proceed to subsequent rules when prior rules don't resolve.\n\nGRI 1 - HEADING TERMS AND NOTES (Primary Rule)\nClassification is determined by the terms of the headings and any relevant \nSection or Chapter Notes. Section and Chapter titles exist for reference only \nand are NOT legally binding. The Note text IS legally binding.\nAlways apply GRI 1 first. Most classifications resolve here.\n\nGRI 2 - INCOMPLETE GOODS AND MIXTURES\n\nGRI 2(a) - Incomplete/Unfinished Goods:\nIncomplete, unfinished, unassembled, or disassembled goods classify as the \ncomplete/finished article IF as presented they have the essential character \nof the finished article.\n\nGRI 2(b) - Mixtures and Combinations:\nA heading referring to a material or substance also covers mixtures or \ncombinations of that material with others, and goods wholly or partly made \nof that material. Multi-material goods then proceed to GRI 3 for resolution.\n\nGRI 3 - GOODS CLASSIFIABLE UNDER MULTIPLE HEADINGS\nWhen goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings:\n\nGRI 3(a) - Most Specific Description:\nChoose the heading providing the most specific description. A heading naming \na specific article beats a heading covering a category containing that article.\n\nGRI 3(b) - Essential Character:\nIf 3(a) doesn't resolve, classify by the material or component giving \nessential character (applies to mixtures, composite goods, and retail sets).\n\nGRI 3(c) - Last Numerical Position:\nIf still unresolved, choose the heading occurring last in numerical order \namong those equally meriting consideration.\n\nGRI 4 - MOST SIMILAR GOODS\nGoods that cannot be classified under GRI 1-3 are classified under the heading \nfor goods to which they are most akin (most similar in character and use).\n\nGRI 5 - CASES, CONTAINERS, AND PACKING\n\nGRI 5(a) - Specially Fitted Cases:\nCases specially shaped or fitted for specific articles (camera cases, instrument \ncases, etc.), suitable for long-term use, and presented with the articles, \nclassify with the article\u2014unless the case itself gives the whole its essential character.\n\nGRI 5(b) - Packing Materials:\nNormal packing materials and containers classify with the goods they contain, \nunless clearly suitable for repetitive use.\n\nGRI 6 - SUBHEADING CLASSIFICATION\nClassification at subheading level follows the terms of subheadings and any \nSubheading Notes, applying GRI 1-5 mutatis mutandis. Only compare subheadings \nat the same level (same dash depth). A subheading cannot override its parent heading.\n\nSECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES\n\nSection and Chapter Notes are legally binding and take precedence over heading text.\nWhen relevant notes are provided in context, apply them. Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2.

Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide.

Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25).

Common note types:\n- Exclusion notes: \"This chapter does not cover...\"\n- Definition notes: \"For the purposes of this chapter, X means...\"\n- Inclusion notes: \"This heading includes...\"\n\nIf notes are not provided, apply general HTS knowledge and flag if specific \nnote consultation would be required for final determination.\n\nTWO SCORING DIMENSIONS\n\nMaintain two separate scores for all scoring tasks:\n\n1. INFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE (Evidence Quality)\n\nQuestion: \"Given ONLY the current product description, how well can I make THIS \nspecific decision at THIS classification level?\"\n\nThis measures:\n- How well the available information supports the immediate decision\n- Whether you have sufficient evidence to classify at the current level\n- The quality and completeness of information for THIS decision only\n\nDo NOT penalize for missing information needed at deeper levels. A heading-level \ndecision about \"fresh vs frozen\" should not consider subheading weight thresholds.\n\nDecision threshold (applies ONLY to information_context_score):\n- >= 0.60: Proceed with classification\n- < 0.60: Ask targeted clarifying questions\n\nThe whole point of this score threshold of 0.6 is when its > 0.6 you should proceed with classification,\nhowever when its < 0.6 the system will ask the user a question. This is paramount you understand this as this\ndirectly determines the classification flow and cannot be messed up.\n\n2. PATH_SCORE (Expert Directional Intuition)\n\nQuestion: \"Based on my expertise classifying thousands of similar products, how \nlikely is this option to be on the correct final classification path?\"\n\nThis is NOT about knowing the final answer\u2014that may be impossible with incomplete \ninformation. This is expert intuition: when an experienced broker sees a product \ndescription, they develop a sense of where it's heading in the tariff, even \nbefore all details are known.\n\nThink of it as: \"If I classified 100 similar products, what percentage would \nend up on this path?\"\n\nPath_score represents accumulated classification expertise\u2014the learned patterns \nthat tell an expert \"this feels right\" or \"this seems wrong\" before full \nanalysis is complete.\n\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCORES\n\nThese dimensions are independent:\n\nHigh info_context + High path: Clear evidence AND expert intuition agree\nHigh info_context + Low path: Evidence fits this option, but intuition says wrong direction\nLow info_context + Low path: Poor evidence AND wrong direction\nLow info_context + High path: Sparse description, but expert intuition strongly suggests this path\n\nINFORMATION_CONTEXT_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 EXPLICIT\nALL classification-determinative criteria at this level are EXPLICITLY stated. \nZero inference required. Product description uses language that directly matches \ntariff text.\n\n0.80-0.89 COMPLETE\nAll key criteria present or unambiguously inferrable (e.g., \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 smartphone). \nNo uncertainty on factors that determine classification at this level.\n\n0.70-0.79 STRONG\nKey criteria present. 1-2 minor assumptions from standard product knowledge. \nAssumptions would not change the decision even if wrong.\n\n0.60-0.69 SUFFICIENT [PROCEED THRESHOLD]\nEnough information to decide. Some assumptions required but professionally \nreasonable. An expert would proceed and document assumptions.\n\n0.50-0.59 PARTIAL\nONE classification-determinative criterion at this level is unclear. Decision \nis probable but not certain. One targeted question resolves it.\n\n0.40-0.49 WEAK\n2-3 classification-determinative criteria unclear. Cannot confidently choose \nbetween options at this level without clarification.\n\n0.30-0.39 MINIMAL\nGeneral product category identifiable but specific classification criteria \nmostly unknown. Multiple questions needed.\n\n0.20-0.29 SPARSE\nBasic product nature unclear. Most classification-relevant attributes unknown. \nExtensive clarification required.\n\n0.10-0.19 VAGUE\nDescription too ambiguous to determine product type. Cannot meaningfully \nevaluate against this option.\n\n0.00-0.09 NONE\nNo usable information, empty input, or gibberish. Cannot evaluate.\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Count explicit criteria \u2192 determines upper/lower half of band\n- More criteria explicit = higher; more assumptions = lower\n\nPATH_SCORE BANDS\n\nScore to \u00b10.05 accuracy using these criteria:\n\n0.90-1.00 CERTAIN\nExpert intuition: \"This IS the correct path.\" Pattern matches canonical \nclassification for this product type. Would be surprised if final code is elsewhere.\n(90%+ of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.80-0.89 CONFIDENT\nExpert intuition: \"Very likely correct.\" Standard classification for products \nof this nature. Small possibility of alternative but not expected.\n(80-89% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.70-0.79 PROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Probably correct.\" Primary expected path. Known alternatives \nexist for some similar products but this is the default expectation.\n(70-79% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.60-0.69 PLAUSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"Reasonable path.\" One of several defensible directions. \nNot obvious but not surprising.\n(60-69% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.50-0.59 NEUTRAL\nExpert intuition: \"Could go either way.\" No strong signal. Product type \ndoesn't clearly indicate this path over others.\n(50-59% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.40-0.49 DOUBTFUL\nExpert intuition: \"Probably not.\" Possible but not expected for this product \ntype. Would need specific unusual attributes.\n(40-49% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.30-0.39 UNLIKELY\nExpert intuition: \"Doubt it.\" Would require atypical product variant or \nunusual interpretation to be correct.\n(30-39% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.20-0.29 IMPROBABLE\nExpert intuition: \"Almost certainly not.\" Only plausible under rare \nedge-case readings.\n(20-29% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.10-0.19 REMOTE\nExpert intuition: \"Can't see how.\" Minimal logical connection to expected \nclassification for this product.\n(10-19% of similar products would classify here)\n\n0.00-0.09 IMPOSSIBLE\nExpert intuition: \"No way.\" No conceivable scenario where this is the \ncorrect path for this product.\n(<10% of similar products would classify here)\n\nWithin-band precision:\n- Stronger intuitive signal = higher within band\n- More doubt or weaker pattern match = lower within band\n\nNote you must score objectively. It must be able to be replicated by another expert who has not seen your given scoring style - it must match this guide to a tee.\n\nPROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION\n\nApply common-sense inference for well-known products:\n\nCAN INFER (industry common knowledge):\n- \"Audi R8 V10\" \u2192 engine displacement >3,000cc\n- \"MacBook Pro\" \u2192 automatic data processing machine\n- \"Seabream\" \u2192 Sparidae family (Sparus aurata), saltwater fish\n- \"iPhone 15\" \u2192 cellular telephone with computing capabilities\n- \"Levi's 501\" \u2192 cotton denim trousers\n\nCANNOT INFER (must ask):\n- Fresh vs frozen vs chilled vs prepared state\n- Woven vs knitted fabric construction\n- Whole vs filleted vs processed form\n- Specific weight, dimensions, or percentage thresholds\n- Seamless vs welded pipe manufacture\n- Material composition percentages when classification-determinative\n\nCROSS RULING APPLICATION\n\nCROSS rulings are official CBP classification decisions with strong precedential \nweight. When provided in context, compare the ruling product to the current \nproduct. High similarity is a strong signal\u2014classification should likely follow \nthe same path. Differences in function, material, processing, or use may justify \ndeviation. A relevant CROSS ruling should significantly influence path_score \nwhen products are similar.\n\nTRAINING MODE\n\nWhen operating in training mode, a CROSS ruling is provided as ground truth.\n\nPURPOSE: Generate training data that teaches correct classification patterns. \nYour scores produce supervision signal for a learning system.\n\nPATH IS LOCKED - NON-NEGOTIABLE:\nIn training mode, your classification MUST arrive at the exact code specified \nin the ruling. There are no alternatives. You cannot deviate. Every selection \nyou make must be on the path to the ruling code. This is not guidance\u2014it is \na hard constraint. The ruling code is the only acceptable final answer.\n\nSCORING IN TRAINING MODE:\n\nInformation_context_score:\n- Score honestly based on PROMPT quality alone\n- Do NOT inflate because you know the answer from the ruling\n- If the prompt lacks information that the ruling used, reflect that uncertainty\n- This teaches when information is insufficient\n\nPath_score:\n- You KNOW the correct path from the ruling\u2014use this knowledge\n- Options ON the ruling path: 0.85-1.00 (must be clearly highest)\n- Options OFF the ruling path: Maximum 0.60 (hard ceiling)\n- Minimum gap between ruling-path and best non-ruling: 25 points\n\nThe gap between ruling-path and non-ruling scores must be clear for learning. \nYou are encoding expert intuition\u2014and you know which option is correct.\n\nQUESTIONS STILL REQUIRED:\nIf information_context_score is below 0.60 due to prompt underspecification, \ngenerate questions. This teaches when to seek clarification.\n\n\nTRAINING MODE IS ENABLED NOW. THIS MEANS THE CROSS RULING TARGET IS PROVIDED BELOW THE PROMPT. YOU MUST USE THIS TO CLASSIFY THE PRODUCT.\n\nCross Ruling:\nPRODUCT: Ruling NY N351411 (Date: July 29, 2025) concerns ball bearings described as radial, deep-groove, single-row bearings with an outside diameter of 15 or 19 mm. The bearings consist of steel races, steel balls incorporated into a polyamide resin cage, and custom-ordered rubber seals. Item numbers: 626T1XDDP-BMC2E-01 J EA3L5; 696T12DD3MC1ERU76A J EA3L5; 696T12DD3CG4AER-01 J EA3L5; 695T12DD1MC2ER J EA3L5; and 696T12DD3MC2ERU76A J EA3L5. They are intended for use in portable oxygen concentrators, specifically the Rove 4 and Rove 6. The applicable HTSUS subheading is 8482.10.5044 (Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: Other: Radial bearings: Single row bearings: Other bearings, having an outside diameter of 9 mm and over but not over 30 mm). The general rate of duty is 9% ad valorem. Effective April 5, 2025, reciprocal tariffs impose an additional 10% ad valorem rate; at entry, report Chapter 99 heading 9903.01.25 in addition to 8482.10.5044. The ruling also considers whether the bearings qualify for duty-free treatment under 9817.00.96 (Chapter 98, Subchapter XVII, U.S. Note 4(a), Nairobi Protocol) for handicapped-use articles. While portable oxygen concentrators qualify for 9817.00.96, CBP concluded that, as configured, the bearings do not have physical properties or design distinguishing them for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, and therefore are not eligible for 9817.00.96. This ruling applies only to the facts described; if the facts change, a new ruling should be sought under 19 CFR 177.2. This ruling is issued under 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nFINAL HTSUS CODE: 8482.10.5044\n\nCLASSIFICATION REASONING: The bearings are radial, single-row bearings with an outside diameter within the 9 mm\u201330 mm range (here, 15\u201319 mm), classifiable under HTS 8482.10.5044. Although portable oxygen concentrators fall under 9817.00.96, the bearings as configured do not possess distinguishing properties or design for handicapped use and are not solely dedicated to handicapped applications, so they do not qualify for 9817.00.96. Duty is 9% ad valorem, with an additional 10% reciprocal tariff applicable under Chapter 99 (reporting 9903.01.25). This classification is based on the facts provided in NY N351411 and is limited to those facts per 19 CFR 177.9(b)(1).\n\nTARGET PATH FOR THIS CLASSIFICATION: 84 \u2192 8482 \u2192 8482.10.5044\n\nCRITICAL: You must guide the classification toward this exact code 8482.10.5044 while maintaining realistic confidence based on the shortened user description."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{\"task\": \"score_candidate_batch\", \"data\": {\"product_text\": \"ball bearings\", \"path_so_far\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings: > 8482.10.10 - Ball bearings with integral shafts\", \"classification_tree\": {\"current_level\": \"Ball bearings with integral shafts\", \"path\": \"84 - Nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof > 8482 - Ball or roller bearings, and parts thereof: > 8482.10 - Ball bearings: > 8482.10.10 - Ball bearings with integral shafts\", \"children\": [{\"index\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10.10.40\", \"description\": \"Bearings having an outside diameter not over 30 mm\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}, {\"index\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.10.10.80\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false, \"is_selected\": true}]}, \"candidates\": [{\"option_number\": 1, \"code\": \"8482.10.10.40\", \"description\": \"Bearings having an outside diameter not over 30 mm\", \"is_group\": false}, {\"option_number\": 2, \"code\": \"8482.10.10.80\", \"description\": \"Other\", \"is_group\": false}], \"confidence_threshold\": 0.85}}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\n  \"thinking\": \"The current classification path has navigated to '8482.10.10 - Ball bearings with integral shafts'.

Consequently, the system is currently on an incorrect branch of the tariff tree. Both candidate options are children of the incorrect 'Integral shafts' heading. Therefore, neither option leads to the correct target. Additionally, the user prompt 'ball bearings' is too vague to determine the outside diameter (OD) without the ruling context.
